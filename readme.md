# MFLIX Application

## Overview
MFLIX is a movie database application that allows users to browse, search, and manage movie-related data. It includes features for user authentication, data management, and error handling, all powered by a MongoDB backend.

See Docs: https://danssaul.github.io/MFLIX/

---

## Business Rules
1. Users can register and log in to access personalized features.
2. Only authenticated users can add, update, or delete movie data.
3. Admin users have elevated privileges to manage all data.
4. Movies must have a title, release year, and genre to be valid.
5. Reviews can only be added by authenticated users and must be linked to a movie.
6. Users can add movies to their favorites and provide feedback.

---

## Authorization and Authentication
- **Authentication**: Implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users must log in to receive a token, which is required for accessing protected routes.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (e.g., USER, PREMIUM_USER, ADMIN) ensures that only authorized users can perform certain actions.

---

## Logging
- **Node Logging**: Uses Winston for logging. Logs are displayed on the console and can be configured via environment variables.
  - Production: Default log level is `info`.
  - Development: Default log level is `debug`.
- **Express Logging**: Uses Morgan middleware.
  - Production: Logs are written to rotated file streams.
  - Development: Logs are displayed on the console.

## MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB is used to store all application data.
- **Collections**:
  - `users`: Stores user credentials and roles.
    ```json
    {
      "_id": "<email string>",
      "name": "<name and last name>",
      "role": "<USER | PREMIUM_USER | ADMIN>",
      "hashPassword": "<bcrypt hash>",
      "expiration": "<time in milliseconds>",
      "blocked": "<true | false>"
    }
    ```
  - `movies`: Stores movie details, including ratings and comments.
  - `comments`: Stores user comments linked to movies.
    ```json
    {
      "_id": "<ObjectId>",
      "email": "<email string>",
      "movie_id": "<ObjectId>",
      "text": "<comment text>"
    }
    ```
  - `favorites`: Stores user favorite movies.
    ```json
    {
      "_id": "<ObjectId>",
      "email": "<email string>",
      "movie_id": "<ObjectId>",
      "viewed": "<true | false>",
      "feedback": "<optional text>"
    }
    ```
